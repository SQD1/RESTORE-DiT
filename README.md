# RESTORE-DiT: Reliable satellite image time series reconstruction by multimodal sequential diffusion transformer


## :speech_balloon: To do list
- [x] Code and configuration for training and test dataset at France site.
- [x] Code for Denoising Transformer.
- [ ] Training code of RESTORE-DiT.
- [ ] Inference code of RESTORE-DiT.



## :speech_balloon: Data preparation

1. **Dataset download**

    Download the original PASTIS-R dataset [here](https://zenodo.org/records/5735646).

2. **Generate Cloud masks**

   The model is trained on cloud-free image time series with simulated masks. So we need to perform cloud/shadow detection to remove cloudy images in each time series. [CloudSEN12](https://github.com/cloudsen12) is used for cloud/shadow detection.
